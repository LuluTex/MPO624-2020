## Barotropic instability of the zonal jet 

Barotropic instability occurs in regions of strong shear like the edges of jet. It gives rise to vorticies (eddies) in the ocean and atmosphere. Here we use data from a shallow water model to study the interaction between eddy momentum flux and mean shear.
